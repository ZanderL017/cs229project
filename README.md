# cs229project

Use run.py to run models.

You can use the default args or run on datasets:

coad
read

with different feature extraction methods:

var
mean
vae
pca

All important code has been transferred to .py files, but some old testing and visualization remains in IPython Notebooks, specifically Data_Viz and Data_Exp.
